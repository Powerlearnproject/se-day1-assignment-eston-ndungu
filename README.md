Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, testing and maintaining software. 
The importance of software enginnering in the technology industry is that it helps software developers create high quality , reliable, and maintainable software that meets the need of its users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1960's - The introduction of software engineering as a discipline
1970's - The emergence of structural programming
2000's - The rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirments - Involves gatthering requirments from users ie user needs
Design - Involves creating detailed designs, software architecture and user interface
Implementation - Involves witing code and building the software according to the design 
Testing - Involves testing the software to ensure it meets all the requirments and is functioning
Deployment - Involves releasing of the software to the users 
Maintenance - Ivolves fixing issues that arise after the software has been deployed and providing ongoing support and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies - are characterized by a sequential approach (requirments, design, implementation, testing, deploying, maintenance) while Agile methodologies are iterative and have an inceremental approach.
Watrefall model relies on extensive front planning while Agile MOdel relies on repeating cycles which makes it flexible.
Waterfall works best for well-defined and unchanging projects while Agile modelis for dynmaic and evolving projects.
Waterfall model can used when creating an online banking system while agile can be used when creating a mobile app



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - They are responsible for writing code and implenting software solutions.
Project Manger - Thet are responsible for oversseing the plaaning, the excectuion and the delivery of software projects.
Quality Assurance Enginner - They are responsible for ensuring software quality theough designing and executing plans.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS tools help in enhancing productivity, collaboration and code quality.
IDES provide tols for writing, testing and debugging code. ie Visual Studio Code, Eclipse etc
VSS provide tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ie Git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines - The pressure to deliver software products on shor period of time or fixed schedule can result in low quality software products due to rushing of the development process.
Changing requirments - Requirments may change during the development life cycle and this might lead to a delay of projects
Technical Debt - This can result to increased maintenance costs
Some of the strategies to help overcome this challenges include: effective communication, collaborations, priotizing tasks, responding to changes etc


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - Involves testing individual components of software
Intergration testing - Involves testing interactions between two different components
System testing - Involves testing the entire software  system as a whole 
Acceptance testing - Involves testing the software against user requirments to ensure it meets the user needs
The importance of the above testing in software quality assurance is that they ensure the identification and fixing of issues early in the development process leading to high quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is process of forming specific set of statements or commands in order to get the best possible responsenses from AI models
Prompt engineering enables the setting of clear and conscise instructons that can can be input to AI models helping them understand and provide detailed and specicic answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about Software Methodologies?
Tell me about the Waterfall Software Methodology?
The improved prompt is more effective because it will give a response that is only focused on the Waterfall model while the vague prompt will give a response pertaining to all methodologies
